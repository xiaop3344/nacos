     * The following VirtualService sets a timeout of 5s for all calls to
     * productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service in Kubernetes. Notice that
     * there are no subsets defined in this rule. Istio will fetch all
     * instances of productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service from the service
     * registry and populate the sidecar's load balancing pool. Also, notice
     * that this rule is set in the istio-system namespace but uses the fully
     * qualified domain name of the productpage service,
     * productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local. Therefore the rule's namespace does
     * not have an impact in resolving the name of the productpage service.
     * {{&lt;tabset category-name="example"&gt;}}
     * {{&lt;tab name="v1alpha3" category-value="v1alpha3"&gt;}}

     * To control routing for traffic bound to services outside the mesh, external
     * services must first be added to Istio's internal service registry using the
     * ServiceEntry resource. VirtualServices can then be defined to control traffic
     * bound to these external services. For example, the following rules define a
     * Service for wikipedia.org and set a timeout of 5s for HTTP requests.
     * {{&lt;tabset category-name="example"&gt;}}
     * {{&lt;tab name="v1alpha3" category-value="v1alpha3"&gt;}}
